The data directory contains:
- the raw transition rates in  Final_merged_data_NGM.txt
- population male frequencies estimates : population_rep_male_freqs.txt
- fertility data from the Cemee: fertility.rda (from Noble et al. 2017)
- Mean state frequencies in the movies : State_freq_NGM.txt

The Rcode directory contains all code to reproduce the analysis.

We also included txt output files showing the different computed G matrices and tables for the manuscript (txt and G_mat_tables directory) and the auto-correlation plots from the MCMCglmm models.

RData files produced by the code are too large and will be stored on Dryad upon publication.
